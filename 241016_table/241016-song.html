                <br>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
                <br>You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
                <br>Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
                <br>You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
                <br>
                <br>Killing me slow, out the window
                <br>I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
                <br>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
                <br>What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
                <br>
                <br>And it's new, the shape of your body
                <br>It's blue, the feeling I've got

                <br>It's a cruel summer

                <br>So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
                <br>I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
                <br>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

                <br>I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
                <br>And I snuck in through the garden gate
